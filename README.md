# Data-preprocessing-with-Weka-TP-03
Here we will conduct a series of tests to choose the best algorithm that we will use in the rest of our tests. we will be using 3 measures of evaluation with to evalu- ate 6 algorithms on the original dataset before any preprocessing then the two best algorithms will be used in the rest of the tests. The results are are taken straight out of wekaâ€™s classifier output and made into text files (will be included with the supplementary files). at the end of the tests there will be a conclusion of the results along with a table that summarises the perfor- mance according to correctly classified instances.
